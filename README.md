# Skyrim Alchemy Web App
## The App
See and use the app live, courtesy of Github Pages:
[Alchemy App](https://the-naive-bayesian.github.io/skyrim-alchemy-web/).

## Goal
Alchemy in Skyrim can be fun, but also tedious.
If you're on your 100th play-through, a little help
putting together decent potions might be appreciated.

This app aims to help alchemy neophyte and master alike
by providing an intuitive and powerful interface to concoct
powerful potions with minimal hassle.
